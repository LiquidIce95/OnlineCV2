# OnlineCV2
Improved version of the OnlineCV (Frontend/Angular Project)

Features:
dynamic dot simulation as background, you can select a dot from the lower quarter of the background and then launch it with new speed and direction, dots collide with edge and among themselves. If in close proximity a line will be drawn where its thickness increases with closer distance.

Overlay when clicking table header (next to eye symbol) to preview attachment from the CV for that table entry. When overlay is closed , user is scrolled to initial screen position before clicking on overlay preview.

Beautiful Design and user experience, top and down buttons (scroll to start and end of application) , nice animations.

TODO: Mobile Version
